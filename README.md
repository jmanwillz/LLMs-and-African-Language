# LLMs and African Language

For this project you will be aiming to assist in performing systematic reviews. You will be working in groups of one, two or three members and they can be different from any of the groups you formed during the labs. A systematic review is essentially a very structured literature review and our models will have two component: 1) a binary recommendation, 2) the extraction of relevant text. The binary recommendation is a label given to a document indicating whether the model believes it is a relevant piece of literature. A label of 1 indicates that it is relevant and 0 indicates that it is not. Secondly, pieces of relevant documents should then be highlighted if it contains important information. For your project, you must perform the systematic review in an African language other than English. To achieve this you must perform two full fine-tuning trainings of your model. The first is a more general fine-tuning of a pretrained model and can be anything you think will be helpful for the final performance of the model. The second fine-tuning is when you then train the model to identify your topic in the chosen language. You can also choose whichever topic you like - systematic reviews are generally done in medicine, however you will already be in a low-resource domain (which medicine is) by using an African language. So being low resource twice over is not a mandatory challenge.
